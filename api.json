      "full": "The Stone Tape Theory is a paranormal hypothesis suggesting that buildings and other physical materials can absorb and store energy from traumatic or emotionally charged events, later \\\"replaying\\\" these recordings as ghosts or hauntings. Named after Nigel Kneale's 1972 BBC television play *The Stone Tape*, the concept predates the term itself, appearing in earlier spiritualist and theosophical literature. The theory proposes that certain materials—particularly those with crystalline structures like stone, brick, and quartz—may act as natural recording media, similar to magnetic tape, capturing impressions of past events that can be triggered under specific conditions. While scientifically unsupported, the theory remains popular in paranormal investigation circles as an explanation for residual hauntings."
